# Example user scripts and task lists

This directory contains example scripts that use publicly available (SPM and OpenNeuro) data in BIDS format.

The tutorials will help you get started with aa, and require only aa and SPM.

The examples in the demos directory show more extended use cases. Additional requirements of the specific analyses are listed in the scripts.
